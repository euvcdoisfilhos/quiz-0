## Observations & issues
- Accessibility and semantics:
  - No `<form>` element is used. Inputs should be inside a `<form>` with action/method to submit data properly.
  - Inputs lack `name`, `id`, and `label` elements — this hurts form handling and accessibility.
  - Buttons contain anchor tags (`<button><a ...>`) which is semantically incorrect and may affect behavior/styling. Use either `<a>` for navigation or `<button type="submit">` inside a form.
  - Missing `alt` text for the Google logo image — currently `alt=""`. Provide meaningful alt text (e.g., `alt="Sign in with Google"`).
  - Links use empty `href=""`. They should point to actual routes or use `#` while developing.
- Security & functionality:
  - No client- or server-side validation provided.
  - Password input is `type="password"` (correct), but there is no hint for password rules or strength meter.
  - Google sign-in is only a visual placeholder — no OAuth flow is implemented.
- Styling:
  - Referenced stylesheet: `/assets/css/cadastro.css` (not included here). Ensure the CSS file exists and paths are correct.
  - Font import uses Google Fonts (Work Sans).

## Suggested improvements
1. Wrap inputs inside a semantic form:
   - Example:
     ```html
     <form action="/login" method="POST">
       <label for="email">E-mail</label>
       <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required />
       ...
       <button type="submit">Logar</button>
     </form>
     ```
2. Add `name` attributes to inputs for server-side processing.
3. Replace button + anchor pattern with either a proper submit button or an anchor for navigation.
4. Implement client-side validation (HTML5 attributes or JS) and server-side validation.
5. Replace placeholder Google sign-in with a proper OAuth 2.0 flow (e.g., using Google Identity Services).
6. Improve accessibility:
   - Use `<label>` tied to inputs via `for` / `id`.
   - Provide descriptive `alt` text for images.
   - Ensure focus states are visible and keyboard navigation works.
7. Consider internationalization if you want to support multiple languages; currently the UI is in Portuguese.
8. Avoid absolute root-based paths (starting with `/`) if you plan to host the site in a subdirectory. Use relative paths or configurable base paths.

## How to use locally
- Quick preview:
  - Open `assets/pages/cadastro.html` directly in a browser.
  - Or serve the repository with a static server:
    - Python 3:
      - In repo root: `python -m http.server 8000`
      - Visit: `http://localhost:8000/assets/pages/cadastro.html`
- Ensure supporting assets are present:
  - `/assets/css/cadastro.css`
  - `/assets/img/google-logo.png`

## Example tasks to make this production-ready
- Add backend endpoints for login and password reset.
- Integrate authentication (sessions, tokens) and secure password handling.
- Add tests for form validation and security checks.
- Replace placeholder links with real routes and implement the "forgot password" workflow.

## Notes about the text/language
- The UI strings are Portuguese:
  - "Página de Login", "Login:", "E-mail:", "Senha:", "Esqueceu a senha?", "Logar", "ou continue com".
- Update text if you want English or multilingual support.
