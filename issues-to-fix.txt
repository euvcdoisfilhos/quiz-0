There’s no <form>. Inputs, validation, and submission behavior should live inside a form with method/action or be wired to JavaScript explicitly.
Use <button type="submit"> instead of wrapping a <button> inside an <a>.
Broken label-for / id linkage

Labels use for="email" and for="senha" but the inputs have no id attributes. Add matching id values so assistive tech links labels to controls.
Input types and validation

Use type="email" for the email field, add required attributes and, if desired, pattern or minlength for better client-side validation.
Accessibility and semantics

Page uses lang="en" while content is Portuguese. Set lang="pt-BR".
Consider using <main>, <header>, ARIA attributes where appropriate.
Provide meaningful aria-labels for non-text controls (e.g., the Google button). The image already has alt but consider alt text describing the action.
Link/button semantics

Don’t wrap interactive controls in anchors. Choose either an anchor (<a>) for navigation or a <button> for actions/submission.
"Esqueceu a senha?" should be a real link to a password recovery page (and not an empty href="").
SEO / metadata / consistency

File is named cadastro.html but title says "Página de Login" and H2 says "Login:" — make naming consistent (login vs. cadastro).
The H1 content "Quiz-0" is fine but avoid ID names with special characters if you plan to target them in CSS/JS.
Internationalization / fonts

Preconnect and font usage are fine. If you serve Portuguese, update lang attribute as noted.
Security considerations

If real auth will be implemented, ensure passwords are sent over HTTPS, avoid exposing sensitive info in client-side code, and implement server-side validation and CSRF protection.
Small suggested corrected structure

Wrap the fields in a <form> with method="post".
Add id attributes to inputs and match label for attributes.
Use type="email" and type="password" and add required.
Use button type="submit" for login and a separate button (or link) for Google auth with aria-label.
