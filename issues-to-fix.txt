If real auth will be implemented, ensure passwords are sent over HTTPS, avoid exposing sensitive info in client-side code, and implement server-side validation and CSRF protection.
Small suggested corrected structure

Wrap the fields in a <form> with method="post".
Add id attributes to inputs and match label for attributes.
Use type="email" and type="password" and add required.
Use button type="submit" for login and a separate button (or link) for Google auth with aria-label.
